Dispose is a method triggered whenever the created object from the stateful widget is removed
permanently from the widget tree. It is generally overridden and called only when the state object
is destroyed. Dispose releases the memory allocated to the existing variables of the state. It is
only used in a stateful widget because you cannot change the state of a stateless widget.

Syntax:

void dispose(){
    //...
    super.dispose();
    //...
}
If you create objects and do not free the memory used by them before their destruction, there will
be chances your application will through a memory leakage in the app store or the play store. It is the exit point of the Stateful Widget. Execution of dispose method is done in the end when the state object had built itself enough times and now there is no need for it to build again. It is the last stage of a widget lifecycle, after this, a state object is destroyed completely. Situations, where you need to call your dispose() method, could be turning off the notifications, unsubscribing, shutting off the animations, etc.
